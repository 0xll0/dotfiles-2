# tmux

I use tmux to run multiple shells inside a single terminal, in addition to all the other benefits that tmux provides, such as session management, persistent history, and detaching.

## Dependencies

- [tmux][tmux] - Terminal multiplexer
- [fish][fish] - The friendly interactive shell

## Installation

```sh
make package=tmux
```

## Usage

Start tmux as you normally would.
