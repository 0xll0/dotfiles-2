# .files

These are my dotfiles. As of 2022, my operating system of choice is still [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), although [installing Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Installation) may prove to be a fun side project.

## History

I have been using GNU/Linux since 2012 and Arch Linux since 2017. My setup was originally [i3](https://i3wm.org/) before I switched to [bspwm](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bspwm). As of 2021, I added [Sway](https://swaywm.org/), although I like switching between GNOME and Plasma as well.

The biggest advantage my dotfiles have is a consistent setup between GTK and Qt applications across multiple window managers. Making GUIs look nice on bspwm was a major task for me, and I'm satisfied with the result. Qt applications also work well under GNOME, with a consistent theme if you're using Arc for everything.

## Old screenshots

Over time my tastes in desktop environments have changed. For nostalgic purposes, here is a collection of screenshots of my usage of GNU/Linux over time.
