# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I use them with [Arch GNU/Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

My dotfiles aim to be simple, straight-forward, and to the point. If you want to know how something works, just `man software` and `/search` for what you need to know!

Key features:

- Universal theming
- Vim-inspired keybinds
- Easy to reproduce

My dotfiles are managed with stow. Different dotfiles are stored in different directories. You can "install" a set of dotfiles by simply running `stow <dir>`, e.g. `stow bspwm`.
