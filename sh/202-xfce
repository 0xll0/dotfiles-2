# After all these years, Xfce is still one of the best desktop
# environments. Although the defaults are bland, you can customize
# it to look however you want.
#
# Alternatively install the `xfce4-goodies` package if you want
# everything instead of the select few applications I choose here.
#
# Note that Xfce doesn't exactly handle HiDPI well, so you might want
# to use bspwm or Plasma instead.
