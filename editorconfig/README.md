# editorconfig

These are the settings I use for editing files. Spaces or tabs do not matter, since the environment you use should make both behave very similarly if not exactly the same.

## Dependencies

None.

## Installation

```sh
make package=ediiorconfig
```

## Usage

If you use my [`.vimrc`](/vim) or [code](/code) config, editorconfig will aleady be applied. Otherwise you should read the [editorconfig][editorconfig] website for how to enable it in your editor.
