# Tari - My Arch Linux setup

[Arch Linux][archlinux], a [GNU/Linux][gnulinux] distribution, lets you build your own environment. Since you only install what you want, it is easy to customize and control.

## Features

- A universal color scheme consistent across all terminal software
- A universal theme across both Qt and GTK applications
- The ability to switch between GNOME, Plasma, and bspwm efficiently
- Full HiDPI support for Qt, GTK, and X-level software applications
- Easily switch between both traditional and HiDPI resolution in the same X environment

## Usage

On a fresh [Arch install](/.archlinux/install-scripts), run `./bootstrap.sh`.
