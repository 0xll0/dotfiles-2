# Tari - A bspwm rice featuring HiDPI support with KDE applications

I use [Arch Linux][archlinux], a [GNU/Linux][gnulinux] distribution, for its bare-bones setup out of the box. This makes it easy to customize and control, since you only install what you need. This guide covers replicating my [bspwm](/bspwm) setup on your Arch Linux machine.

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Install Arch Linux

Install Arch Linux like you normally would, following the [Installation guide][archguide]. Although I keep some of my install scripts in this directory, the actual installation process varies depending on your hardware and which setup you're trying to achieve. For this reason, my scripts should only be used as a guide *after* you have a proficient understanding of how Arch Linux works.

### Step 2. Install packages
