# PKGBUILDs

I use PKGBUILDs to know exactly what I have on my machine, and to make it easy to sync changes across multiple Arch installations.

Note that you can install multiple DEs and WMs at once, then switch between them with your display manager (although the practicality of this is questionable).

## Packages

- [bspwm-round-corners-git](/.archlinux/PKGBUILDs/bspwm-round-corners-git) - X11 window manager with border_radius support
- [color-scripts](/.archlinux/PKGBUILDs/color-scripts) - Color scripts, purely for aesthetics
- [tari-core](/.archlinux/PKGBUILDs/tari-core) - Meta package for my Arch Linux installation
- [xeventbind](/.archlinux/PKGBUILDs/xeventbind) - Useful to change X DPI on resolution change
