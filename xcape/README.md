# xcape

[`xcape`](https://github.com/alols/xcape) makes Caps Lock the escape key on press and the control key when used in combination with other keys. This is especially useful for vim and other programs so you don't have to reach for the escape key or the ctrl key

By default, `.xmodmap` only adds the `Ctrl` functionality. To add the `Esc` functionality, use `xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape'`.
