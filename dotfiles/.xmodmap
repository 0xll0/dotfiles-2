! Make Caps Lock the escape key on press and the control key when used in combination with other keys
! Especially useful for vim and other programs so you don't have to reach for the escape key or the ctrl key

! This file makes the caps lock key function as ctrl and esc
! Note that you must run xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape' to add the escape functionality
! TODO: See if this can be expressed in the config file itself

! Clear both the caps lock and control keys
clear lock
clear control

! Set the caps lock key to Control_L
keycode 66 = Control_L

! Reassign the control command to the caps lock and control keys respectively
add control = Caps_Lock Control_L Control_R
