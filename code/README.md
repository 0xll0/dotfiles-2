# Code

[Code][code] is an open source build of [a popular][vscode] GUI text editor.

## Use Cases

Code can be used to:

- Navigate graphical file trees entirely with the mouse
- Provide an editor for non-vim users as needed
- Perform a myriad of common command line operations through a point-click GUI

You should not use Code if:

- You want to learn how compilers, git, find, grep, and other software work
- You want to learn [vim](/vim), the standard text editor

## Usage

Once Code is installed, run `make code-extensions` to install the extensions I use.
